### What is HTML and what is it used for?

#### First developed by Tim Berners-Lee in 1990, HTML is short for HyperText Markup Language. HTML is used to create electronic documents (called pages) that are displayed on the World Wide Web.

### What is it's purpose?

#### The Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is a standard for describing the structure and presentation of information via the Internet. Scott Loban shows how you can use HTML keywords and tags to format and display the content of Web pages.

### What is a html document?

#### An HTML document is a file containing HyperText Markup Language, and its filename most often ends in the .html extension. An HTML document is a text document read in by a Web browser and then rendered on the screen.

### What do you mean by tags?

#### HTML tags are the hidden keywords within a web page that define how your web browser must format and display the content. Most tags must have two parts, an opening and a closing part. For example, <html> is the opening tag and </html> is the closing tag.
